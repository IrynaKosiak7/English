What are your strengths? – I decided to change my career and completed a challenging course, because I was motivated to succeed in IT. 
I have learned German in 1 years for B1 level and have learned in 10 months a very hard specialty in IT.  I always complete tasks before the deadline.

Can you share a weakness?  -  I’m not great at English, but I’m working on it. I’m perfection. I sometimes worry too much about a problem, because I want to find a solution.
